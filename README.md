Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is sytematic application of enngineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
Software enineering enable creation of software application and systems that power various aspects of modern life eg, communication and commerce.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
programming language invention was attributed to Ada Lovelace in 1840s, however actual implementation of program language,Fortran, was in 1950s.
software engineering as a discipline was established in 1960.
There was emergence of structured programming in 1970, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirement involves gathering and documenting user needs and sytem requirements
design involves creating high level and detailed designs of software and user interface
implementation involves writing actual code
testing involves conducting tests of the software
deployment involves realeasing software to the users
maintainance involves providing ongoing support and updates.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is when we approach software development sequentially with distinct phases in the development while agile methodology is iteractive and 
incremental approach where we focus on flexibility,collaboration and responding to changes. Waterfall would be ideal for big organisations or government projects
with set deadlines and clear goals. agile approach works best with small web development project where we depend on feedback to build more user centered products.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes codes and builds software according to design , a quality assurance engineer test the software and ensures the software is of good quality. 
project managers oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments are Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g., Visual Studio. 
 Version Control Systems (VCS) are Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g., Git. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challenges faced by software engineers include;
Changing Requirements- Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines- Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt- Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Testing is a critical aspect of QA and involves various types of testing, including:
   Unit Testing- Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing-Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
   System Testing- Testing the entire software system as a whole.
   Acceptance Testing- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
   Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is  crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
'tell me about dogs' vs ' write a 200 word document about the history of german sherpherds'. the improved prompt is more specific.
